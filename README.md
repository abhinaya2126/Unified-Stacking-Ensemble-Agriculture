# A Unified Stacking Ensemble Framework for Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction

This repository contains the Google Colab notebooks and datasets used in the paper:

“A Unified Stacking Ensemble Framework for Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction”.

The project evaluates multiple machine learning models and a stacking ensemble
approach for crop recommendation and yield prediction using three agricultural datasets.
